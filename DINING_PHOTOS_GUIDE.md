Instructions for Adding Real Dining Location Photos
===================================================

To add real photos of PSU dining locations, you have two options:

OPTION 1: Download and Add to Static Folder
--------------------------------------------
1. Take or find photos of each dining location:
   - Gibson Dining Hall
   - Gorilla Crossing (Overman Student Center)
   - The University Club
   - KTC Cafe
   - Axe Grind (Starbucks in Axe Library)

2. Save images to: static/images/dining/
   - gibson.jpg (or .png, .webp)
   - gorilla_crossing.jpg
   - university_club.jpg
   - ktc_cafe.jpg
   - axe_grind.jpg

3. The app will automatically use these images from the seed data

OPTION 2: Use External URLs
----------------------------
If you have image URLs from:
- PSU's official website
- CampusDish.com
- Social media (with permission)

Update the seed_dining_halls.py file with the direct image URLs.

CURRENT IMAGE PATHS:
--------------------
The seed script currently uses:
- /static/images/dining/gibson.jpg
- /static/images/dining/gorilla_crossing.jpg
- /static/images/dining/university_club.jpg
- /static/images/dining/ktc_cafe.jpg
- /static/images/dining/axe_grind.jpg

RECOMMENDED IMAGE SIZES:
------------------------
- Width: 1200-1600px
- Height: 800-900px
- Aspect Ratio: 16:9 or 3:2
- Format: JPG or WebP (optimized)
- Max file size: 500KB per image

WHERE TO FIND PHOTOS:
---------------------
1. Take your own photos during campus visit
2. Check PSU's official social media (Instagram: @pittsburg_state)
3. Check PSU's Gorilla Connection news articles
4. Contact PSU Marketing Department for official photos
5. Search "Pittsburg State dining" on Google Images (verify usage rights)

TEMPORARY SOLUTION:
-------------------
The template currently shows crimson gradient placeholders if images are missing.
This looks clean and professional until real photos are added.
