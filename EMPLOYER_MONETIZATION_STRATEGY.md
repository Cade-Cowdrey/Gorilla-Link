Hi [Name],

I saw you posted [Job Title] on Gorilla-Link. How's it going?

[Listen to response]

Great! I wanted to share something interesting:

Most of our Professional members hire 3-5 students per year.

Want to try it for a month? I can give you 50% off your first month.

## 💡 THE SECRET SAUCE

**Why This Works:**
1. **FREE tier eliminates risk** - Employers try before they buy
2. **Data proves value** - Show them EXACTLY what they're missing
3. **ROI is undeniable** - Hiring 1 student pays for a year of Professional
4. **Scholarships = PR wins** - Tax-deductible goodwill
5. **Exclusive access** - "Only PSU students, not competing with millions"

**Why Employers Will Pay:**
- They're ALREADY spending $4,700 per hire elsewhere
- They're ALREADY wasting time on Indeed/LinkedIn
- They're ALREADY struggling to find qualified candidates
- We offer better results at 1/5 the cost
