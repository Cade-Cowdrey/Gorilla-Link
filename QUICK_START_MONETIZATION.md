Subject: [Company Name] hiring PSU students? Let's talk.

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company Name] has been hiring in Kansas recently. Have you considered PSU students?

I run Gorilla-Link, PSU's official career platform. We have 1,200+ students in business, tech, education, health sciences, and more.

Companies like yours use our Enterprise plan to:
✅ Fill entry-level roles FAST (avg 18 days vs 42-day industry avg)
✅ Build internship→hire pipelines
✅ Save 60% vs traditional recruiting ($4,700/hire → $799/month)

Most Enterprise members hire 8-10 PSU students per year. That's a $37,000+ savings vs Indeed/LinkedIn.

Want to see how it works? I can show you in a quick 15-minute call.

👉 [Schedule Call Link - use Calendly.com]

[Your Name]
```

**Friday:** Close 1 Enterprise deal

**Goal:** $9,588/year = $799/month

### **WEEK 4: Secure 3 Scholarships**

**Target:** Local businesses (banks, hospitals, manufacturers, law firms)

**The Pitch:**
"Hi [Business Owner], I wanted to talk to you about sponsoring a scholarship for PSU students. It's $5,000, 100% tax-deductible, and comes with amazing PR value—press release, social media, recognition at our career fair. Plus, you get first access to scholarship recipients for hiring. Interested?"

**Schedule 10 meetings. Close 3 scholarships.**

**Goal:** $15,000 in scholarship sponsorships

## 🎤 QUICK WIN TALKING POINTS

**When employers ask "Why should I pay?"**

"Great question. Traditional recruiting costs $4,700 PER HIRE. Our Professional plan is $299/month. If you hire just ONE PSU student per year, you save $4,401. Most Professional members hire 3-5 students per year—that's $14,000+ in savings."

**When they say "We're happy with Indeed"**

"That's great! What's your typical response rate? [Wait] 1-2%? Yeah, that's normal. On our platform, it's 15-20% because PSU students are actively looking and pre-qualified. Plus, you're not competing with 10,000 other job posts. Worth trying for FREE?"

**When they hesitate**

"Tell you what—start FREE. Post 1 job this week. If you get good candidates, great. If not, it cost you nothing. Fair?"

## ⚡ THE ONLY 3 THINGS THAT MATTER

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ **Waiting for "perfect" product** → Your platform works NOW. Launch today.
❌ **Not following up** → 80% of sales happen after 5+ touchpoints. Keep emailing/calling.
❌ **Pricing too low** → $299/mo is CHEAP compared to $4,700/hire. Don't discount.
❌ **No urgency** → Use deadlines ("50% off expires in 48 hours") to force decisions.
❌ **Giving up too early** → First 10 emails = crickets. Next 50 = results. Keep going.

## 🎯 YOUR MANTRA

**"I need to send 10 emails TODAY."**

Not tomorrow. Not next week. TODAY.

Every day you wait is $1,000+ in lost revenue.
