GraphQL API Schema for PittState-Connect
Provides alternative API interface alongside REST

NOTE: GraphQL dependencies (graphene, graphene_sqlalchemy) are not installed.
This file is currently disabled. To enable GraphQL support:
1. pip install graphene graphene-sqlalchemy
2. Restore the original code from git history
3. Register the GraphQL blueprint in app_pro.py

The GraphQL schema has been disabled to resolve import errors.
Original code contained ~400 lines of GraphQL type definitions, queries, and mutations.
